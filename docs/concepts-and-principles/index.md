title: Concepts & Principles
---

This is where I explore the fundamental building blocks of how things work â€“
both the core ideas and the underlying truths that guide effective design.
It's my collection of foundational concepts and guiding principles,
along with my takes on why and how they should be understood and applied.
It's about getting to the "why" and "what" behind various technical subjects.
